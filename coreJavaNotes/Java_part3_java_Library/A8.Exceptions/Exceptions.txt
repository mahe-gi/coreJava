Exceptions in java
==================
the problem that occures during execution of a program(run-time) due to abnormal statement 
or instructions is known as exception.

int[] a = new int[3];
a[1] = 10;-->normal statement
a[4] = 20;-->abnormal statement
here, exception occurs during the execution.

When exception occures and not handled, the execution of the program stops abroptly.
						Normal execution
							|
							|
							|		
			------------<<=false------abnormal statements-------true=>>------
			|								|

		normal execution						exceptin occur

			|								|
			|								|
			|								|	
		execution ends--------------------------------------<=true-----if exception handled---false-=>---
 														|
														|
													incomplete execution
When exception occures, Throwable type object is created.
(java.lang.Throwable is the superclass of all things you can throw or catch (exceptions and errors) in Java)


types of exception :
in java,exceptions are classified into two types (w.r.t. compiler it is divided)
1.un-checked exceptions
2.checked exceptions

un-checked exceptions
=====================
the compiler un-aware exceptions are known as un-checked exceptions.it is not mandatory to handle or declare 
un-checked exceptions.

checked exceptions
==================
the compiler aware exceptions are checked exceptions.it is mandatory for programmer to either handle or declare 
checked exceptions, else we get CTE(un-reported exception CTE)
