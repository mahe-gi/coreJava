Classification of array Based on Size

Fixed-Size Arrays
-----------------
Once created, the length cannot be changed. This is the traditional array you declare 
like int[] arr = new int[5]; or initialize as int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};. 


Dynamic Arrays (via ArrayList)
------------------------------
Not technically arrays, but flexible list structures like ArrayList<Integer> allow 
resizing during runtime. These are dynamic and manage memory allocation.

Classification Based on Dimensions
==================================
1)One-Dimensional Arrays
A simple, linear collection of elements accessible via a single index, like int[] 
singleDim = {1, 2, 3};. 

2)Two-Dimensional & Multi-Dimensional Arrays
Structured like grids (2D) or higher-dimensional matrices.
for example, int[][] matrix = new int[3][3];. 

3)Jagged (Ragged) Arrays
These are special multidimensional arrays where each sub-array (row) can have a 
different length. 
For example : 

int[][] jagged = {{1, 2},{3, 4, 5},{6}};

Additional Array Behavior in Java
==================================
1.Java arrays are objects and inherit from java.lang.Object. 

2.Arrays can store primitive types (like int, char, boolean) as well as object references (like 
String, Integer), but all elements must be of the same declared type. 

3.Arrays use zero-based indexing, and once their size is set, it cannot be altered.

| **By Size**       | Fixed-Size              | Length is immutable once declared                    |
|                   | Dynamic (via ArrayList) | Resizable structure—behaves like arrays but flexible |

| **By Dimensions** | One-Dimensional         | Simple linear array                                  |
|                   | Two-/Multi-Dimensional  | Arrays of arrays, like grids or cubes                |
|                   | Jagged Arrays           | Nested arrays with variable row lengths              |


int [] a = {1,2,3,4,5};
class name : [I
there is no package where you'd find int[] or char[] as a normal class—they're implemented behind the 
scenes by the Java during runtime.
