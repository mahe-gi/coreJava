1.What are all the escape sequences in Java and their uses.

Common escape sequences in Java include:
\n: Newline. Inserts a line break, moving the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
\t: Tab. Inserts a horizontal tab space.
\b: Backspace. Moves the cursor back one position, effectively deleting the character before it.
\r: Carriage Return. Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

\f: Form Feed. Inserts a form feed character, often used to indicate a page break in older printing systems.
\\: Backslash. Represents a literal backslash character. This is necessary because the backslash itself is 
used to initiate escape sequences.
\': Single Quote. Represents a literal single quote character. This is used when a single quote needs to be part 
of a character literal or a string literal that is itself enclosed in single quotes.
\": Double Quote. Represents a literal double quote character. This is crucial when a double quote needs to be 
part of a string literal that is enclosed in double quotes, to avoid premature termination of the string.
