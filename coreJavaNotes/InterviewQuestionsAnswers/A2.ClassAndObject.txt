1.can we have multiple classes in single java file?
Yes we can have multiple classes in a single file.

2.Can a class be a public or default?
Yes a class can be only public or default.

3.Can a class be private or protected?
No class cannot be private or protected.

4.Can inner-class be private or protected?
Yes inner class can be private or protected.

5.can we declare multiple public classes in a single file?
no there should be only one public class in a file.

6.What should be the file name if we have multiple classes in a file.
file name should be same as public class name in the file.

7. How can we access static methods from the other class?
By using class name as reference we can access static methods from the other class.

8. How can we access static variables from the other class?
By using class name as reference we can access static variables from the other class.

9. How to access non static variables or non static methods from the other class?
In order to access non static members like variables or class we have to create 
object for the respective class and we use that object reference variable to call a non 
static member of that particular class.

10. What is class in Java?
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.

11. What is object in Java?
an object is the real entity.class doesnt exist in the real world but the objects are.

12. which one is logical entity class or object?
.class is the logical entity and object is the real entity.

13. what are all the components that a class can contain?
Data member(variable)
Method
Constructor
Nested Class(a class inside the class)
Interface

14. what are all the components that an object contains?
identifier
state 
behaviour

15. What are the types of variables that a class can contain?
Static variables,non static variables and local variables.

16. What happens when we declare a class as public?
If a class declared as public you can access that class and its components from 
other packages also.

17. What happens when we declare a class as default?
if a class is declared as default we can access the class and its components 
within the same package.


18. In how many ways can we create object In java?
There are five ways to create object in Java.
1.Using new keyword
className obj = new ClassName();

2.Using clone() method
		ObjectCreation original = new ObjectCreation();
		ObjectCreation copy = (ObjectCreation) original.clone();
		System.out.println(original.k);

3.Using Deserialization
------------------------------------------------------
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(...);
out.writeObject(original);

// Deserialize
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(...);
MyObject obj = (MyObject) in.readObject();

4.Using Constructor.newInstance() from Reflection API
------------------------------------------------------
Constructor<MyObject> ctor =
    MyObject.class.getDeclaredConstructor(/* types */);
ctor.setAccessible(true);
MyObject obj = ctor.newInstance(/* args */);



this 5th way of creating object is not in use from java version 9
5.Using Class.forName().newInstance()
---------------------------------------
MyObject obj = (MyObject)Class.forName("com.example.MyObject").newInstance();

19. How will you identify a variable should be a static or a non static?
If the variable is going to change its value from one object to another object 
so that variable will be considered as non static. If the variable is going to be 
same for all the objects then such type of variables considered as static variables.

20. How will you identify a method to be a static or non static in Java?
if a method uses any non static variables then method should be non static otherwise static.
