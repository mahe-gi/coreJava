final Keyword in Java
=================
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used to restrict the user.

1. Uses of final Keyword
----------------------------
a. Final Variable
Meaning: Its value cannot be changed once assigned (acts like a constant).

Declaration Example:
final int MAX_USERS = 100;
Must be initialized at the time of declaration or in the constructor (for instance variables).

b. Final Method
Meaning: Method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

Usage Example:
class Parent 
{
    final void display() 
    {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent 
{
    // void display() { } // Error: cannot override final method
}


c. Final Class
Meaning: Class cannot be inherited (no subclasses).

Usage Example:

final class Vehicle 
{
    // class content
}

class Car extends Vehicle 
{ // Error
}



2. Important Points
===================
1.Final variable = constant value(you cannot re-initialize it)

2.Final method = cannot be overridden

3.Final class = cannot be extended

4.Final variables do not require initialization if declared as local blank final variables, but they must be initialized before use.

5.Final can be used with instance variables, static variables, local variables, parameters, methods, and classes.

6.Final does not mean immutability for objects. It prevents reassignment of the reference variable, but internal state can change.
final C ob2 = new C();


Example:
final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");
sb.append(" Programming"); // Allowed     -->"Java Programming"
// sb = new StringBuilder("Python"); // Error


3. Final with Inheritance
Final Class: Cannot have child classes.

Final Method: Cannot be overridden in child classes.

Final Variable: Cannot be reassigned.

4. Final Parameters
You can declare method parameters as final to prevent them from being modified within the method.

Example:
void show(final int x) 
{
    // x = 10; // Error
    System.out.println(x);
}

5. Final vs Finally vs Finalize()
Keyword	Usage
final	Non-access modifier for variables, methods, classes
finally	Block used in exception handling
finalize()	Method called by garbage collector before object destruction
