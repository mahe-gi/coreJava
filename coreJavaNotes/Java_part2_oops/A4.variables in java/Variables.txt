Variable is a memory block used to store the data.

There are two types of variables.
1. Global variable.
2. local variable.

local variables
===============
1. Variables which are declared within the method are called local variables.
2. These variables are used within the method. We cannot use these variables outside the method.
3. these variables must be initialised to use.
4. Scope of local variables will be within the method.
5. Default values will not be there for local variables.
6. formal arguments of a method are local variables.

syntax : datatype variableName = data;
local variables will not have any access nodifiers as well as no static key word.

Global variables.
================
variables which are declared outside a method but inside the class are called global variables.
There are two types of global variables.
1. Static variable
2. non static variable.

Syntax of global variable:
modifier static data-type variable_name = data;

2. Global variables have default values if developer forgets to initialise the variable.
Default values of different data types.
boolean->false
int-> 0
double-> 0.0 
char->empty character 
string-> null

3.These global variables can be accessed in any of the methods in the same class.
4. Static variables can be used in any of the methods directly.
5. Non static variables can be used only with the help of object reference variable.
