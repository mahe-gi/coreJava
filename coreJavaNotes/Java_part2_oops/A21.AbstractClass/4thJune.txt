class --> only complete methods
we can have constructor in a class
we also can create object of a class

abstract class--> can have complete methods + abstract methods
we can have constructor in an abstract class.
we cannot create object of abstract class.

interface(pure abstract class) --> can have only abstract methods(before java 8)

java 8 --> Now, you can write complete methods but those complete methods must be
default method(non-static) or static method.
cannot have constructor.
we cannot create object for interface

class-class ==> extends
abstract class to class==> extends
interface - interface ==> extends
interface-class==> implements

by default, all the methods will be public and abstract.

by default, all the variables will be final, static and public.
