Abstract method/ incomplete method
----------------------------------
if a method is having only method signature but no implementation.
public void pay();

Concrete method / complete method
---------------------------------
if a method is having both method signature and method implementation.
public void pay()
{

}


if any class is containing abstract methods, then class also becomes
abstract class.

these incomplete methods/abstract methods will be implemented in
sub classes.

if sub-class does not complete the incomplete method
in other words
if sub-class does not implement the abstract method
in other words
if subclass does not over-ride the abstract method
then sub-class also will become abstract.

to force every sub class to over-ride a specific method, we
declare that method as abstract.


Complete method says : " i have given default implementation, if you dont like it, please over-ride the method"
incomplete method says : "i dont know anything about opeatation/implementation, compulsory you have to over-ride the method"

abstract class can have both complete as well as incomplete emthods.

if a class is abstract, we cannot create objects.why?
there is a possiblity that user may call incomplete method from oject reference.
to avoid this, oracle restricted ocject creation for abstract class.

can abstract methods be final? why?
No, because we must over-ride the abstract method.but if you make any abstract emthod final
sub-classes cant over-ride the method.

can abstract method be static?why?
No,because we cannot over-ride static methods.

can abstract method be private?Why?
No,cannot be accessed from other classes to override.


Can abstract class have constructor?why?
Yes, abstract class will have constructors
1.to intialise non-static global varials which are present in the abstract class.
2.constructor chaining.
