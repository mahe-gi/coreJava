Method overloading
------------------
same method with different argument list.

to achieve method overloading:
===============================
1. We have to have multiple methods with the same method name but with a different list of arguments.
2. Modifiers can be different in method overloading process.
3. Return type of a method can be different type in method overloading process provided list of arguments are different.
4.Both static and non static methods can be overloaded.
5.Main method also can be overloaded.

Advantages of method overloading:
1.we can perform the same operation with different arguments.
2.improve flexibility in coding.
3. Easier maintenance of the code.
