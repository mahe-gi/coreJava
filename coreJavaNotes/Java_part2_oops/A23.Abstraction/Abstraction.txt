Abstraction.
============
1.hiding method implementation details and providing access only to method signature is called abstraction.
2.In simple terms hiding unnecessary details and providing access only to the necessary details is called abstraction.

abstraction can be achieved in two ways 
by using interface 
by using abstract class.

Hotel menu: this is interface containing food names only.(not how they are prepared)//method names, not method implementation.

waiter : receives order from you(helper method).

chefs and cooks are hidden from you.(they will be there in the kitchen) if you come to know who is the chef, there is a possibility that 
you can meet them directly and know the recipie.

waiter goes to specific chef and gets the food ready. food will be served to you.

here, chefs and preparestion way is hidden from you(you means main method).

Design of Abstraction
------------------------
interface Sample
{
	void test();
}

class Run implements Sample
{
	public void test()
	{
		System.out.println("Test is completed : ");
	}
}
thiss helperClass hides implementation class details and its logics to you.
class HelperClass
{
	public static Sample getObject()
	{
		Sample s1 = new Sample();
		return s1;
	}
}

class MainClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Sample rv = HelperClass.getObject();
		rv.test();
	}
}
